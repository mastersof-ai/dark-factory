# Dark Factory — Deprecated

> **This project has been deprecated.** Its successor is [@mastersof-ai/harness](https://github.com/mastersof-ai/harness), a multi-agent runtime built on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-agent-sdk).

Dark Factory took a skills/prompt approach — markdown files that Claude Code interprets as workflows. With Claude Opus 4.6, that's no longer the right abstraction. The agentic approach in `@mastersof-ai/harness` is more capable, more flexible, and where all future development is happening.

## Migration

```bash
# Uninstall Dark Factory
npx @mastersof-ai/dark-factory uninstall

# Install the harness
npm install -g @mastersof-ai/harness
```

See the [harness README](https://github.com/mastersof-ai/harness#readme) for setup instructions.
